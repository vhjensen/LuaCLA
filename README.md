This is an implementation of the Cortical Learning Algorithm pioneered by Numenta.
I based this code off the whitepaper pseudocode, which it follows very literally.

I will be adding a GUI with Love2D at some point for visualization experiments.

At this point in time, it appears the system is functioning as intended.

If you use it in anything interesting, let me know!
